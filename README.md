# Roaring Societies

**Roaring Societies** is a digital history project exploring the profound societal and cultural shifts that defined the 1920s in the United States. This repository serves as the codebase and content archive for the project.

## 🏫 Project Context

This project was created for **AP US History (APUSH)** to analyze the "Roaring Twenties," a decade characterized by economic prosperity, cultural dynamism, and significant social change.

## 📖 Overview

The 1920s were not just about jazz and flappers; they represented a fundamental clash between tradition and modernity. "Roaring Societies" investigates these tensions through several key lenses:

- **Consumer Culture:** The rise of mass consumption, advertising, and the automobile.
- **Changing Roles for Women:** The emergence of the "New Woman," the Flapper image, and the impact of the 19th Amendment.
- **Cultural Renaissance:** The Harlem Renaissance and the explosion of Jazz culture.
- **Social Tensions:** Prohibition, the resurgence of nativism, and the Scopes Trial.
